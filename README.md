# CHAPTER_1
Introducing Flutter and Getting Started

In this chapter, I've learned the foundational concepts and initial steps that necessary to start developing apps using Flutter. Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit by Google for building applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Also, I've learned that the Flutter uses the Skia 2D rendering engine that works with different types of hardware and software.

I've learned that Widgets are the building blocks of a Flutter application. In Flutter, everything is a widget - whether it's button, text, layout structure, or even the entire app itself. Widgets define the structure, appereance, and behavior of the user interface. 

The StatelessWidgets and StatefulWidgets are the two main types of widgets in Flutter. They are used to build the user interface, but they serve different purposes depending on whether the widgets appearance or behavior needs to change during its lifecycle. So lets differentiate why the two of them have a different purposes, first the StatelessWidget is a widget that does not require mutable state. It is used for displaying only the static content that does not change after it is built, while the StatefulWidgets is a widget that can rebuild itself dynamically based on changes in its internal state. 

Lastly, I've learned how to install Flutter Extension and Dart Extension in VS Code.
